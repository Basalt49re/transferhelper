## Better than ASSIST.org

### Before

- üê¢ Manually check for requirements
- üòì No built-in way to track course selections
- üíÄ Waste counselor time checking ASSIST.org during appointments

### After
- ü•π View all colleges and majors in a single page
- üêá Automatically picks the best requirements
- ü§ì Built-in way to track course selections
- üëç Start your counseling session PREPARED!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR A COLLEGE COUNSELOR ‚ö†Ô∏è

You can use this tool to help you plan your transfer, but it is not a replacement for a college counselor.
